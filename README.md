# Uni-Police-Record-Website-Project

A basic website for tracking police traffic incident records where I learn how to use a MySQL and PHP backend with a Svelte frontend. I found separating the backend to be really convenient for testing with Postman.

I faced challenges when putting this project onto other servers and environments so created a few files that would dynamically change routes, paths, and database credentials depending on their directory location and URL path.
